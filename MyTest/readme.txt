This sample uses MEF (Managed Extensions Framework) to dynamically import modules into the MVC project structure.

Project was generated by using a simple MVC 5 project template and then adding the following changes:
1. Created a Modules folder with a MyPlugin folder containing standard MVC structure of Controllers, Models and Views folders. Layouts, Scripts can also be added if desired.
2. Added Bootstrapper.cs, CustomControllerFactory.cs and CustomViewEngine.cs
3. Modified Global.asax.cs to invoke functionality from above 3 classes
4. Test urls http://localhost:62090/ for out of the box functionality and http://localhost:62090/Test for TestController to view MEF driven plugin functionality in action.
